# cplAmazon

A Firefox Addon that injects a Chicago Public Library reserve link
into an Amazon book page. Assumes the exact ISBN for now

This is largely a work in progress. It will get better.

It turns out, Amazon gives very different views for logged in and
logged out. My tests were all for the logged out view, so this only
works if you're logged out. I'll fix it up.

If you want to install the add-on, it's <a
